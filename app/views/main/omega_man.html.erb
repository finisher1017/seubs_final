  <div class="col-sm-11"><p>This was one of the most difficult, but rewarding projects that I worked on during my time in film school. The assignment, which was for my Sound 2 Class, was to select a script for an existing film and adapted it into a 2-5 minute piece using only sound effects, voice over, and music. No visuals.</p></div>

  <div class="col-sm-11"><p>It was originally supposed to be a group project with me and two other guys, but the bums couldnâ€™t be bothered to keep in touch or contribute anything meaningful. Three weeks behind schedule with a week to go before the project is due, I finally realize that the bums are never going to contribute anything, so I take it upon myself to write the script for the project and put it together all by myself. I spent countless hours in post production labs at my school putting together as many sound effects, music cues, and voice overs that I could scrounge together in a week. It was a grueling process, but I was able to finish the project the night before it was due and ended up getting the highest grade in the class.</p></div>
